# Introduction to the College Data Management System Project

## Overview

The College Data Management System (CDMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate various administrative and academic processes within a college. This system aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of managing student information, academic records, timetables, notifications, and more. The project is divided into two main components: the front-end and the back-end.

### Front-End

The front-end of the College Data Management System is developed using modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface. It provides various features such as user authentication, profile management, timetable viewing, notifications, and settings management.
